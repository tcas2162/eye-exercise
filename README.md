# eye-exercise
This was one of the first exercises that gave me the ability to use the skills I learned to manipulate styles by combining HTML and CSS with Javascript. I created a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement/actions that are input by the user. There are no dependencies or additional packages that need to be installed-simply load the page, move your mouse around and watch the magic of Javascript at work!

In future revisions to this project, I'd like to build upon the exercise by making an entire face reactive (i.e. stretchable) and/or 3D-somewhat like tne exercise on the title screen of Super Mario 64-to demonstrate my continued growth and comfort with the Javascript programming language.
