# eye-exercise
This was one of the first exercises that gave me the ability to use the skills I learned to manipulate styles by combining HTML and CSS with Javascript. I created a web page with two eyes that follow the mouse movement/actions that are input by the user. There are no dependencies or additional packages that need to be installed-simply load the page, move your mouse around and watch the magic of Javascript at work!
